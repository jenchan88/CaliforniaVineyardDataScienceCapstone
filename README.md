# Vineyard Soil Microbiome Analysis

Statistical analysis of microbial abundance data to identify treatment-responsive modules in vineyard soils.

## Methodology
- **Differential Correlation Network Analysis:** Computed correlation shifts across 14 treatment conditions to identify dynamic microbial interactions.
- **Custom Hierarchical Clustering:** Implemented a novel distance metric based on statistical significance (p-value) to cluster microbes into co-responsive groups.
- **Large-Scale Analysis:** Processed 1,000+ samples to identify 28 statistically significant microbial modules showing consistent responses to agricultural treatments.
