metric = diagonal sum / upper triangular sum

the matrix we use is:
[A functions, shared A-B functions, shared A-C functions]
[shared A-B functions, B functions, shared B-C functions]
[shared A-C functions, shared B-C functions, C functions]




Carbon: Decomposition/Respiration.
Nitrogen: Nitrate Reduction/Reaction functions.
